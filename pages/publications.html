<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
A density functional theory-based method is developed to describe the static and dynamic response of superfluid helium at finite temperatures.
The model relies on the well-established 0 K Orsay–Trento functional, which has been extensively used to study the response of bulk
superfluid helium as well as superfluid helium droplets. By including a phenomenological stochastic term in this model, it is possible to obtain
thermodynamic equilibrium corresponding to a given temperature by propagating the system in imaginary time. The temperature dependence
of thermodynamic quantities, such as the internal energy and entropy, is computed and is compared well with experimental reference
data for the bulk liquid up to about 2 K, but begins to gradually deviate above that temperature. Inspection of pseudovorticity during real-time
evolution of the system near 2 K reveals the presence of roton quasiparticles, which are suggested to be precursors for quantized vortex rings
(Onsager’s ghosts), as well as weaker analogs of extended vortex loops.<br>
